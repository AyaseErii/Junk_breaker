# CSCB58H3 FPGA Project - Blok Buster

Blok Buster is a Brick Breaker clone for the [Altera DE2-115](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/solutions/partners/partner-profile/terasic-inc-/board/altera-de2-115-development-and-education-board.html) FPGA board written in Verilog.

The top-level Verilog module is `Proj` located in `project.v`.

## Project Status

As of Saturday March 14 2020, all CSCB58H3 Winter 2020 projects have been cancelled in the midst of the current COVID-19 👑🍺🦠 situation.
Development on this project is at a standstill and will likely remain so for years to come.

We didn't get a lot of time to work on this project and make it into something of our own, but that's just the way things go sometimes.

## Requirements

* Altera DE2-115 FPGA board
* Monitor with VGA input
